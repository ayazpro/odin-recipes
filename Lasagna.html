<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fluffy couscous pairs superbly with chicken. Nutty and versatile, it makes a great addition to aromatic Moroccan stews and tagines, to chicken salad bowls, and to grilled chicken, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
<li>1 pound ground beef chuck. </li>
<li>1/2 medium onion</li>
<li>diced (about 3/4 cup).</li>
<li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow)</li>
<li>diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
    <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
    <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
</ol>
    </ul>
